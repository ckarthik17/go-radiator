GO Radiator
====================

Forked from [go_radiator](https://github.com/TheDitt/go_radiator) thanks to [TheDitt](https://github.com/TheDitt) for creating this superb application

**Setup:**

Project uses :
- Bundler
- Shotgun
- Rack
- Haml

  To get up and running all that should be needed is to install the Ruby gem
Bundler if up don't already have it installed then run:  

$ bundle install

  That should install everything that is need for the app to run. To start it
run:  

$ shotgun

  As is the case with any Shotgun app you can update the config.ru file to
change Shotgun settings. Like wise /config/deploy.rb for the Vlad settings and
Gemfile for your bundler install settings

enjoy!
