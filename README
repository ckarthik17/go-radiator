GO Radiator is simple program inspired by the origin written by Roy Morgan (in .Net), which was a windows app to read the CCTray
out put form GO which works brilliantly but! and there is a but it's design gives some short coming firstly because it's a windows
app every monitor that we want to display a GO Radiator on has to have computer and GO login account associated with it.
The way you add pipelines to display isn't brilliant and can get difficult to manage so I started the new Ruby / Sinatra / Haml
version to solve some of these problem and move the idea forward.

In summary the new architecture is very simple there's a Sinatra web service that can return JSON or a HTML view of the pipelines.
The login code is separate and I'm thinking of making that a separate project or even Gem. Now this is about as fare as I've got at the moment.
The next feature that need to be implemented are:
- Error handling on Ajax requests
- Build breaker name
- Profile creation (e.g. profile a has pipelines a, c and f to display)
- GO Error display
- ....
